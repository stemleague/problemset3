# Crack the Code: Problem Set 3

# Problem: Given an integer x, return true if x is palindrome integer. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.
# For example, 121 is a palindrome while 123 is not.

# TODO: Write 5 test cases you expect reverse_string() should output (Ex: reverse_string("hi") --> "ih"). Get 
# creative - what if we get empty string? What about casing of the string?
