# Crack the Code: Problem Set 2

# Problem: Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

# STEP 1: Clarify your questions and assumptions

# Question 1:
# Question 2:
# Question 3:



# STEP 2: Whiteboarding
#
# TODO: Write 5 test cases you expect reverse_string() should output (Ex: reverse_string("hi") --> "ih"). Get 
# creative - what if we get empty string? What about casing of the string?

# STEP 4: Testing Your Code
# Convert your above test cases from Step 2 into actual function calls and run your code to check if your function works.


# STEP 5: Optimize Your Code
# TODO: There is no correct answer, but out of your best guess, what is your code's time complexity?
